## Path Resolution

### Marketplace Paths (`marketplace.json`)

The `source` field in each plugin entry is resolved **relative to the marketplace.json file location** (not the `pluginRoot`):

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "pluginRoot": "./plugins"  // Informational only, not used for resolution
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "source": "./plugins/my-plugin",  // Relative to marketplace.json
      "category": "development"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key rule:** `source` must start with `./` and include the full path from `.claude-plugin/` to the plugin directory.

### Plugin Paths (`plugin.json`)

Each plugin's `plugin.json` uses paths relative to its own location. Component discovery (skills, agents, hooks) is automatic from the plugin root.

## Building Skills for Claude Web

Skills in this marketplace use the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to restrict tool access in Claude Code. However, this field is **only supported in Claude Code** and must be removed for Claude Web compatibility.

The `build-skill-for-web.sh` script creates Claude Web-compatible ZIP archives by stripping Claude Code-specific fields:

```bash
./build-skill-for-web.sh ./plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>
# Output: <skill-name>.zip
```

### Why is this necessary?

According to [Claude Code Skills Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

> `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.

Skills uploaded to Claude Web will ignore this field. The build script ensures clean ZIPs without unsupported fields.
